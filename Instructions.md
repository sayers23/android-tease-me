This program is just a viewer of the teases referenced here or created by downloading teases using the original windows version of tease me.

Teases need to be put on the SD card under

Android/data/uk.co.ormand.teaseme/files

when you run the program for the first time it should create the directory
it will also create an empty file called .nomedia which will tell Android not to index the directory (you will not see pictures in the gallery etc.)

(the data directory can now be changed in the preferences)

The font size can be set in the preferences.
The number of letters per row for buttons can be set in the preferences.
Dynamic buttons mean it is hard to guess how many buttons per row.
The if the total number of characters for buttons on the current row exceeds this number it will start a new row.
If there are too few buttons on a row increase the number.
If buttons are over flowing the row reduce the number.

New full screen mode select-able in preferences will display the image full screen with the text and buttons on top
